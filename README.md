# phaser-game

## Repository Description
In preparation for an upcoming game jam, I thought it would be ideal to learn Phaser 3. Phaser 3 is a framework for creating HTML5 games.

## Running Locally
There are a few options for running this game locally. I chose to use [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) through node.js since I'm used to working through the command line. Just run "npm start" in your terminal to open the game!
